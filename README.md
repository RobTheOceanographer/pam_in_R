# WELCOME TO THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF PAM!

This program is brought to you by Rob Johnson, Simon Reeves, Shihong Lee, and Emma Flukes. We are PhD students at the University of Tasmania and we were fed up with the ridiculous amount of time it was taking to analyse PAM Rapid Light Curves using clunky and expensive stats software (copy... paste... copy... paste... SPSS... boooo!). So, we built the PAM Processor! using the free and open stats scripting language R and the web application tool Shiny.

At the moment this is release v1.0 of the PAM Processor! as of June 2015.

**For Installation and running instructions please read the INSTALL.md document.**
